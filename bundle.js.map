This gives all the language-specific linters a framework to plug into inside Atom, letting them display linting messages on screen as you type.</p>\\n<p>I always use <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-standard\\\"><code>linter-js-standard</code></a> for linting JavaScript projects of my own design. <a href=\\\"http://standardjs.com\\\">Standard Stye JavaScript</a>, in my estimation, is the best standard out there for code styling. One caveat: make sure to go into its settings and verify that Atom won’t use Standard to lint something with different linting rules, e.g. a project that has its own <code>.eslintrc</code> file.</p>\\n<p>As a full-stack JavaScript developer, I depend on the Atom packages <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint\\\"><code>linter-eslint</code></a>, <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/linter-stylelint\\\"><code>linter-stylelint</code></a>, and <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/linter-jsonlint\\\"><code>linter-jsonlint</code></a>. Many other packages for <code>linter</code> exist, for all your different coding needs.</p>\\n<h3>Editing and Writing Code</h3>\\n<p>I don’t know how I lived without <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/color-picker\\\"><code>color-picker</code></a>. Right-click and you can pull up a color picker that spits out the value you want in RGB, HSL, hex, etc.</p>\\n<p>Another must-have color package is <a href=\\\"https://github.com/abe33/atom-pigments\\\"><code>pigments</code></a>. This shows all instances of colors against a background of that color. So when you type <code>#2c64af</code>, it’ll actually show you what color that is (it’s a soft blue). This is particularly useful when you’re working in something like Sass, where colors can take their values from variables.</p>\\n<p>Atom has a way to use <a href=\\\"http://editorconfig.org/\\\">EditorConfig</a> with the <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig\\\"><code>editorconfig</code></a> package. This is a must-have for maintaining a consistent coding style when people in your project are working in different editors or IDEs. It reads its settings from the <code>.editorconfig</code> file in your project.</p>\\n<p>One of the most useful packages is <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/emmet\\\"><code>emmet</code></a>, which lets you expand abbreviations so you can avoid typing the same repetitive sequences over and over. This is particularly important when you’re writing HTML or CSS.</p>\\n<p>Another package you’ll want for writing HTML is <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/autoclose-html\\\"><code>autoclose-html</code></a>. When you type <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> it’ll automatically add <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> for you. This also works when you’re writing JSX</p>\\n<p>I use <a href=\\\"https://github.com/atom/sort-lines\\\"><code>sort-lines</code></a> for assisting with some extremely tedious sorting (obviously).</p>\\n<p>Use the <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/atom-pair\\\"><code>atom-pair</code></a> package to do remote pair-programming sessions. There are even hooks for integrating this with Slack and HipChat.</p>\\n<h3>Development</h3>\\n<p>If what you’re doing touches the web, you’ll most likely need the <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/open-in-browser\\\"><code>open-in-browser</code></a> package. If you are sticking with Sublime simply because that feature is built in, now might be the time to switch.</p>\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/minimap\\\"><code>minimap</code></a> package is another must-have. It displays a small map of your code off to the side of your editor. There are plugins for <code>minimap</code>, such as <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/minimap-git-diff\\\"><code>minimap-git-diff</code></a> to talk to the <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/git-diff\\\"><code>git-diff</code></a> package.</p>\\n<p>Speaking of Git, here are a lot of packages to make Git work nicely inside Atom, without having to bring up the Git command line for many common tasks. My favorite is <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/git-plus\\\"><code>git-plus</code></a>, though <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/git-control\\\"><code>git-control</code></a> and <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/atomatigit\\\"><code>atomatigit</code></a> have their devoted followers.</p>\\n<p>If you’re working in React, check out <a href=\\\"http://nuclide.io\\\"><code>nuclide</code></a>. It’s a pretty spiffy IDE for React projects. I’m excited to see it continue to develop.</p>\\n<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>\\n<p>Now that I’ve switched to Atom completely, I find myself missing the old built-in Tetris game in emacs (<code>M-x tetris</code>). Thank goodness for the Atom package <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/tetromino\\\"><code>tetromino</code></a>.</p>\\n<p>What did I miss? What are your favorite Atom packages? Let me know below!</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 388 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(2);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _reactDocumentTitle = __webpack_require__(373);\n\t\n\tvar _reactDocumentTitle2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reactDocumentTitle);\n\t\n\tvar _config = __webpack_require__(366);\n\t\n\tvar _ContactListItem = __webpack_require__(389);\n\t\n\tvar _ContactListItem2 = _interopRequireDefault(_ContactListItem);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\t\n\tfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\t\n\tfunction _possibleConstructorReturn(self, call) { if (!self) { throw new ReferenceError(\"this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called\"); } return call && (typeof call === \"object\" || typeof call === \"function\") ? call : self; }\n\t\n\tfunction _inherits(subClass, superClass) { if (typeof superClass !== \"function\" && superClass !== null) { throw new TypeError(\"Super expression must either be null or a function, not \" + typeof superClass); } subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass && superClass.prototype, { constructor: { value: subClass, enumerable: false, writable: true, configurable: true } }); if (superClass) Object.setPrototypeOf ?

Part of what makes Atom so great is its package ecosystem. However, the sheer number of packages available can often be intimidating and confusing. I thought I’d share the highlights of what’s currently in my Atom configuration and hopefully provide some package-navigation guidance people who may be thinking of giving Atom a try as well as Atom veterans.</p>\\n<h3>Code Linting</h3>\\n<p>The most important Atom linting package, of course, is <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/linter\\\"><code>linter</code></a>. This gives all the language-specific linters a framework to plug into inside Atom, letting them display linting messages on screen as you type.</p>\\n<p>I always use <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-standard\\\"><code>linter-js-standard</code></a> for linting JavaScript projects of my own design. <a href=\\\"http://standardjs.com\\\">Standard Stye JavaScript</a>, in my estimation, is the best standard out there for code styling. One caveat: make sure to go into its settings and verify that Atom won’t use Standard to lint something with different linting rules, e.g. a project that has its own <code>.eslintrc</code> file.</p>\\n<p>As a full-stack JavaScript developer, I depend on the Atom packages <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint\\\"><code>linter-eslint</code></a>, <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/linter-stylelint\\\"><code>linter-stylelint</code></a>, and <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/linter-jsonlint\\\"><code>linter-jsonlint</code></a>. Many other packages for <code>linter</code> exist, for all your different coding needs.</p>\\n<h3>Editing and Writing Code</h3>\\n<p>I don’t know how I lived without <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/color-picker\\\"><code>color-picker</code></a>. Right-click and you can pull up a color picker that spits out the value you want in RGB, HSL, hex, etc.</p>\\n<p>Another must-have color package is <a href=\\\"https://github.com/abe33/atom-pigments\\\"><code>pigments</code></a>. This shows all instances of colors against a background of that color. So when you type <code>#2c64af</code>, it’ll actually show you what color that is (it’s a soft blue). This is particularly useful when you’re working in something like Sass, where colors can take their values from variables.</p>\\n<p>Atom has a way to use <a href=\\\"http://editorconfig.org/\\\">EditorConfig</a> with the <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig\\\"><code>editorconfig</code></a> package. This is a must-have for maintaining a consistent coding style when people in your project are working in different editors or IDEs. It reads its settings from the <code>.editorconfig</code> file in your project.</p>\\n<p>One of the most useful packages is <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/emmet\\\"><code>emmet</code></a>, which lets you expand abbreviations so you can avoid typing the same repetitive sequences over and over. This is particularly important when you’re writing HTML or CSS.</p>\\n<p>Another package you’ll want for writing HTML is <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/autoclose-html\\\"><code>autoclose-html</code></a>. When you type <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> it’ll automatically add <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> for you. This also works when you’re writing JSX</p>\\n<p>I use <a href=\\\"https://github.com/atom/sort-lines\\\"><code>sort-lines</code></a> for assisting with some extremely tedious sorting (obviously).</p>\\n<p>Use the <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/atom-pair\\\"><code>atom-pair</code></a> package to do remote pair-programming sessions. There are even hooks for integrating this with Slack and HipChat.</p>\\n<h3>Development</h3>\\n<p>If what you’re doing touches the web, you’ll most likely need the <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/open-in-browser\\\"><code>open-in-browser</code></a> package. If you are sticking with Sublime simply because that feature is built in, now might be the time to switch.</p>\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/minimap\\\"><code>minimap</code></a> package is another must-have. It displays a small map of your code off to the side of your editor. There are plugins for <code>minimap</code>, such as <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/minimap-git-diff\\\"><code>minimap-git-diff</code></a> to talk to the <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/git-diff\\\"><code>git-diff</code></a> package.</p>\\n<p>Speaking of Git, here are a lot of packages to make Git work nicely inside Atom, without having to bring up the Git command line for many common tasks. My favorite is <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/git-plus\\\"><code>git-plus</code></a>, though <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/git-control\\\"><code>git-control</code></a> and <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/packages/atomatigit\\\"><code>atomatigit</code></a> have their devoted followers.</p>\\n<p>If you’re working in React, check out <a href=\\\"http://nuclide.io\\\"><code>nuclide</code></a>. It’s a pretty spiffy IDE for React projects. I’m excited to see it continue to develop.</p>\\n<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>\\n<p>Now that I’ve switched to Atom completely, I find myself missing the old built-in Tetris game in emacs (<code>M-x tetris</code>).
